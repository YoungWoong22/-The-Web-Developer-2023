// Let's get some practice defining constants. In index.js, please define the following two variables:

// Define a constant called boilingPointC and set it to 100. 

// Define a second constant called boilingPointF and set it to 212. 

// That's it!

// YOU CODE GOES HERE:
const boilingPointC = 100;
const boilingPointF = 212;
